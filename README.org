This repository is exactly what you think it is.
Should you be tempted to try these settings, proceed with caution.

** Requirements
The following software packages are required to setup the dotfiles:
- git
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html][stow]]

** Getting started
To setup the dotfiles run

you can try to delete them, be careful as this doesn't keep any backups.

#+begin_src bash
  make delete
#+end_src


** Testing
test stowing config files with

#+begin_src bash
  make test
#+end_src
